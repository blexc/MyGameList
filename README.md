# How to use MyGameList:
 - Create an account first by inputing your usename and password where
 	it says 'Login/ create an account', and hit submit. This is the same
	process for logging in.
 - To add a game to your list, go to Add/ update game. Insert the name
 	of the game, rating, date of completion, and review. Then, press
	submit. This is the same process for updating your game.
 - To delete a game from your list, click on the 'x' button on the right
 	of the table.
